BEGIN Getting Started With MediaBox
This is a quick tour to get you started with MediaBox.

The toolbar has three buttons:

 • PREVIOUS
     takes you back to the previous page

 • CONTENTS
     views the table of contents for skipping directly to a topic
 
 • NEXT
     takes you to the next page
END


BEGIN The Navigator
IMAGE illus/navigator.jpg
The navigator window lets you browse your media by tapping on icons.
The toolbar to the right has three buttons:

 • HOME
    takes you to the start folder (the shelf)
 
 • HISTORY
    shows a list of recently visited folders
   
 • BACK
    takes you back to the previous folder
END


BEGIN The Shelf
IMAGE illus/shelf.jpg
The start folder in the navigator is called the shelf. This is where you have access to

 • music, videos, pictures
 • the filesystem and UPnP media shares
 • playlists
 • MediaBox settings
 • ... and your shortcuts

By default MediaBox is preconfigured with shortcuts for your Documents folder, your SD card, and this tour.
END


BEGIN Selecting Items
On Nokia N800 and N810:

Tap on an item once to highlight an item, and tap again on the item to select it.
The double-tapping approach was chosen to go well with these device's touch screen.

On other devices:

Tap on an item once to select it. The single-tapping approach goes well with
highly responsive touch screens.
END


BEGIN Putting Items on the Shelf
IMAGE illus/add-to-shelf.jpg
Tap and hold on an item in the navigator that you want to put on the shelf. In the popup menu choose the option

 → Add to Shelf
 
Likewise, to remove an item from the shelf, tap and hold on it and choose the option

 → Remove from Shelf
 
You can put almost any item in the navigator on the shelf for quick access.
END


BEGIN Playing Media
IMAGE illus/player.jpg
Find the media item you want to play in the navigator.

Shortly tap on the icon to play the media file. This will open the media player and hide the navigator.

To go back to the navigator, tap on the NAVIGATOR button in the bottom-left corner.
END


BEGIN Controlling Playback
IMAGE illus/player-controls.jpg
The player toolbar has three buttons:

 • PREVIOUS
   skips to the previous media file
   
 • PLAY / PAUSE
   pauses and resumes playback
   
 • NEXT
   skips to the next media file
   
In the image viewer, PLAY / PAUSE starts and stops the slideshow.
END


BEGIN Seeking
IMAGE illus/seek.jpg
The video and music players have a seek bar where you can tap to skip to any position in the file.

Not all media files support seeking.

Tip: You can fine-tune the position by dragging. The seeking starts only after you release the screen.
END


BEGIN Media Bookmarks
Pressing on the star button next to the progress bar in the audio and video players bookmarks the current position, marking it by a star on the progress bar.

Click on a star bookmark on the progress bar to jump to that position.

You can drag star bookmarks on the progress bar to reposition them. Drag the bookmark out of the progress bar to the left or right side in order to remove it.

Not all media files support seeking and thus bookmarking positions.
END


BEGIN Volume Control and Zooming
The INCREMENT and DECREMENT buttons on top of your device can be used for controlling the audio volume, or in the image viewer, for zooming in and out.

You can also control the audio volume with the volume slider on the left side of the screen in the music and video players.
END


BEGIN Fullscreen Mode
The image viewer and video player have a fullscreen mode.

Double-tap on the screen to go fullscreen, or back.
END


BEGIN Filling Playlists
You can add a media item to a playlist by tapping and holding on it. In the popup menu, choose the option

 → Add to Playlist
 
After that you will be asked to which playlist you want to add the file. The playlist "Playlist" always exists, regardless whether you have created new playlists.

You can add folders to playlists, too. Adding a folder automatically adds all the items inside that folder.
END


BEGIN Creating, Clearing, and Deleting Playlists
Press the
 → Add New
button in the Playlists folder to create a new playlist. Enter a name for the list.

Tap and hold on a playlist to open its popup menu. Choose
 → Clear List
from the menu to remove all items from the playlist.

Tap and hold on a playlist to open its popup menu. Choose
 → Delete List
from the menu to delete the playlist.

The preconfigured special lists cannot be deleted.
END


BEGIN Removing Items from a Playlist
Tap and hold on an item in a playlist to open its menu. Choose

 → Remove from List

from the popup menu in order to remove it from the list.
END


BEGIN Arranging Items in a Playlist
IMAGE illus/sort-playlist.jpg
Playlist items can be rearranged.

To change the order of items in a playlist, drag an item by holding down its ridged area on the right side. Move the item to where you want it and release it.

If you move the item to the top or bottom of the screen, the list of items will scroll in that direction automatically.
END


BEGIN The "Recent 50" List
IMAGE illus/recent50.jpg
The special list "Recent 50" lists the 50 recently played media files.

The list is sorted in chronological order, the most recent items first.

Playing an item from the list moves it to the top of that list.

This list can be cleared but not removed.
END


BEGIN Tip: Queuing Media for Playback
While a playlist is playing, you can still add items to it.

Thus you can use a playlist easily for queuing media.
END


BEGIN Tip: Use Playlists as Folders
Playlists on the shelf can be used as folders for grouping your stuff together.

Simply create a new playlist, put it on the shelf, and use this playlist as target when adding items to playlist.

Furthermore you can sort playlists in any way you like.
END


BEGIN Browsing the Local Filesystem
IMAGE illus/filesystem.jpg
Go to [Storage & Network → Filesystem]
for browsing the local Linux filesystem. MediaBox only shows files that it recognizes as media files.

Browsing the filesystem is for advanced users. For regular users, the two folders

 [home → user → MyDocs (My Documents)]
and
 [media → mmc1 (SD card)]
 
already have shortcuts on the shelf.
END


BEGIN Deleting Files
While browsing the local filesystem under

 [Storage & Network → Filesystem]
 
you can delete files by selecting

 → Delete File
 
from their popup menu and confirming with YES.

Deleting a file removes it from the device. Be careful with this function. You cannot delete files that belong to the operating system, but you can, e.g., delete your ringtones.
END


BEGIN Shuffle and Repeat
IMAGE illus/shuffle-repeat.jpg
In the media player window, tap on the title bar to open the application menu.

The repeat and shuffle options are (from left to right):

 • no repeat
 • loop over
 • repeat the same item over and over
 
 • linear playback without shuffling
 • shuffled playback
END


BEGIN Tip: How to shuffle over all your music
Enable shuffled playback.

Then go to [Music → Folders → All Tracks]
in the navigator and start playing a track.
END


BEGIN Browsing UPnP/DLNA Media Shares
UPnP media shares in your network appear in

 [Storage & Network]

You can browse UPnP shares normally like the local filesystem.

MediaBox supports playing music, videos, and viewing images from UPnP media shares.

MediaBox may not be compatible with all UPnP media shares.
END


BEGIN Saving Files from UPnP/DLNA Media Shares
You can save files from media shares onto your device.

Tap and hold on a media item or folder to open the popup menu. Choose

 → Download
 
from there.

Downloading a folder will recursively download all its media contents.
END


BEGIN Playing on UPnP Media Renderers (1)
You can play music and videos on compatible UPnP media renderers in your network, e.g. for watching a movie on the big TV screen, or listening to music on your HiFi set.

In the media player tap on the window title to open the application menu. Choose

 → Select Media Renderer
 
from there and select your media renderer device from a list.

MediaBox may not be compatible with all UPnP media renderers.
END


BEGIN Playing on UPnP Media Renderers (2)
Note:

Streaming media from your device to a renderer causes a lot of network traffic and may decrease your device's battery life.

You can also direct media from a media share to a media renderer, in which case MediaBox will only act as remote control without impact on battery life.
END


BEGIN Playing Web Content - Internet Radio
You can browse the SHOUTcast internet radio directory under

 [Music → SHOUTcast Radio]
 
The SHOUTcast (http://www.shoutcast.com) directory lists thousands of internet radio stations of various genres.

You can add custom stations under

 [Music → Internet Radio]

Tip: You can put stations you like on the shelf for quick access.
END


BEGIN Playing Web Content - YouTube
You can browse clips from the YouTube video sharing service under

 [Videos → YouTube]

Some videos are available in different formats and qualities. If there is more than one compatible format available, MediaBox will let you choose a format.

Some content from the YouTube service or the service in general may not be accessible in your country, either for political reasons or interests of the content industry.
END


BEGIN Saving Files from YouTube
You can save files from YouTube onto your device.

Tap and hold on a media item to open the popup menu. Choose

 → Download
 
from there. If more than one compatible format of a video is available, MediaBox will let you choose a format.
END


BEGIN Managing Downloads
Choose the menu item

 → Downloads
 
from the application menu.

A dialog will appear that shows you the currently active downloads. Click on the [ABORT] button to the right of a download item to abort that download.
END


BEGIN Transmitting to a FM Radio
IMAGE illus/fmtx.jpg
The N900 is equipped with a FM transmitter in sales regions where permitted by law.

Select → FM Transmitter
from the application menu to configure it.

MediaBox sends song title information via RDS text. 

RDS song information is limited to 64 characters and not supported by many RDS-capable FM radios. Many radios will only display the station name ("MediaBox").
END


BEGIN Music Lyrics
IMAGE illus/lyrics.jpg
Timed LRC and A2-enhanced LRC format music lyrics are automatically displayed in the audio player if available.

Put a LRC lyrics file with same name but with extension .lrc next to a music file to enable lyrics for that file.

Plain text lyrics and lyrics embedded in ID tags are currently not supported.
END


BEGIN Portrait Mode Operation
IMAGE illus/portrait-mode.jpg
Portrait mode can be enabled in the settings

 [Settings → Display Orientation]
 
You can choose whether the INCREMENT and DECREMENT keys on top of the device get swapped in portrait mode.

Video playback is not supported in portrait mode and you will only hear sound. This is a current limitation of the Maemo OS.
END


BEGIN Tip: Quick Access For Switching Orientation
Put the

 → Display Orientation
 
configurator icon on the shelf for accessing it quickly to switch display orientations.
END


BEGIN The File Index (1)
MediaBox maintains an index over your media files.

This lets you, for instance, browse your music by artist, or gives you quick access to all your videos without you having to locate them in the filesystem.

Files that no longer exist get automatically removed from the index when you start MediaBox.
END


BEGIN The File Index (2)
On the N900, the built-in tracker file indexer is consulted for a list of available media files.

However, it may take some time until tracker discovers a particular file.

If you don't want to wait, or don't use tracker for MediaBox at all, you can tell MediaBox to scan particular folders for media files immediately.

To do so, find the folder under [Storage & Network → Filesystem] and tap and hold on it to open its popup menu. Select

 → Scan for Media
 
from the menu.
END


BEGIN The File Index (3)
It is possible to disable automatic file indexing altogether and only use manual scanning.

If you want to disable automatic indexing, go to

 [Settings → Media Indexing]
 
and uncheck the checkbox

 → Always update index at startup
 
From now on, you have to scan folders manually if you want to put them in the index.
END


BEGIN Media Player Backends
MediaBox supports various backends for playing media, depending on the platform it's running on.

Go to

 [Settings → Player Backends]

to configure the backend to be used for a media type.

Be careful, as inappropriate backends may cause problems or unexpected behavior. If you don't exactly know about the details of the backends, it's recommended to keep the default settings.
END
