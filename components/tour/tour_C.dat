In the image viewer, PLAY / PAUSE starts and stops the slideshow.
END


SUBBEGIN Volume Control and Zooming
The INCREMENT and DECREMENT buttons on top of your device can be used for controlling the audio volume, or in the image viewer, for zooming in and out.

You can also control the audio volume with the volume slider on the left side of the screen in the music and video players.

END


SUBBEGIN Media Bookmarks
Pressing on the star button next to the progress bar in the audio and video players bookmarks the current position, marking it by a star on the progress bar.

Click on a star bookmark on the progress bar to jump to that position.

You can drag star bookmarks on the progress bar to reposition them. Drag the bookmark out of the progress bar to the left or right side in order to remove it.

Not all media files support seeking and thus bookmarking positions.
END


SUBBEGIN Shuffle and Repeat
IMAGE illus/shuffle-repeat.jpg
In the media player window, tap on the title bar to open the application menu with:

Then go to [Music → Folders → All Tracks]
in the navigator and start playing a track.
END


BEGIN Media Playlists
You can arrange media in playlists for controlling playback.
END

SUBBEGIN Filling a List
You can add a media item to a playlist by tapping and holding on it. In the popup menu, choose the option

 → Add to Playlist
 
After that you will be asked to which playlist you want to add the file. The playlist "Playlist" always exists, regardless whether you have created new playlists.

You can add folders to playlists, too. Adding a folder automatically adds all the items inside that folder.
END


SUBBEGIN Creating, Clearing, and Deleting Lists

END


SUBBEGIN The "Recent 50" List
IMAGE illus/recent50.jpg
The special list "Recent 50" lists the 50 recently played media files.

The list is sorted in chronological order, the most recent items first.

Playing an item from the list moves it to the top of that list.

This list can be cleared but not removed.
END


SUBBEGIN Tip: Queuing Media
While a playlist is playing, you can still add items to it.

Thus you can use a playlist easily for queuing media.
END


SUBBEGIN Tip: Lists as Folders
Playlists on the shelf can be used as folders for grouping your stuff together.

Simply create a new playlist, put it on the shelf, and use this playlist as target when adding items to playlist.

Furthermore you can sort playlists in any way you like.
END


BEGIN Browsing the Local Filesystem
IMAGE illus/filesystem.jpg
Go to [Storage & Network → Filesystem]
for browsing the local Linux filesystem. MediaBox only shows files that it recognizes as media files.

Browsing the filesystem is for advanced users. For regular users, the folder [My Documents] and the SD card already have shortcuts on the shelf.
END


SUBBEGIN Deleting Files
While browsing the local filesystem under

 [Storage & Network → Filesystem]
 
you can delete files by selecting

 → Delete File
 
from their popup menu and confirming with YES.

Deleting a file removes it from the device. Be careful with this function. You cannot delete files that belong to the operating system, but you can, e.g., delete your ringtones.
END


BEGIN UPnP/DLNA Devices
END


SUBBEGIN Browsing Media Shares
UPnP media shares in your network appear in

 [Storage & Network]

You can browse UPnP shares normally like the local filesystem.

MediaBox supports playing music, videos, and viewing images from UPnP media shares.

MediaBox may not be compatible with all UPnP media shares.
END


SUBBEGIN Saving Files from Media Shares
You can save files from media shares onto your device.

Tap and hold on a media item or folder to open the popup menu. Choose

 → Download
 
from there.

Downloading a folder will recursively download all its media contents.
END


SUBBEGIN Playing on UPnP Media Renderers (1)
You can play music and videos on compatible UPnP media renderers in your network, e.g. for watching a movie on the big TV screen, or listening to music on your HiFi set.

In the media player tap on the window title to open the application menu. Choose

 → Select Media Renderer
 
from there and select your media renderer device from a list.

MediaBox may not be compatible with all UPnP media renderers.
END


SUBBEGIN Playing on UPnP Media Renderers (2)
Note:

Streaming media from your device to a renderer causes a lot of network traffic and may decrease your device's battery life.

You can also direct media from a media share to a media renderer, in which case MediaBox will only act as remote control without impact on battery life.
END


BEGIN Playing Web Content
END


SUBBEGIN Internet Radio
You can add custom stations under

 [Music → Internet Radio]

Tip: You can put stations you like on the shelf for quick access.
END


SUBBEGIN The SHOUTcast Directory

The SHOUTcast (http://www.shoutcast.com) directory lists thousands of internet radio stations of various genres.
END


SUBBEGIN YouTube
You can browse clips from the YouTube video sharing service under

 [Videos → YouTube]

Some videos are available in different formats and qualities. If there is more than one compatible format available, MediaBox will let you choose a format.

Some content from the YouTube service or the service in general may not be accessible in your country, either for political reasons or interests of the content industry.
END


SUBBEGIN Saving Files from YouTube
You can save files from YouTube onto your device.

Tap and hold on a media item to open the popup menu. Choose

 → Download
 
from there. If more than one compatible format of a video is available, MediaBox will let you choose a format.
END


BEGIN Managing Downloads

from the application menu.

A dialog will appear that shows you the currently active downloads. Click on the [ABORT] button to the right of a download item to abort that download.
END


BEGIN Transmitting to a FM Radio
IMAGE illus/fmtx.jpg
The N900 is equipped with a FM transmitter in sales regions where permitted by law.

Select → FM Transmitter
from the application menu to configure it.

MediaBox sends song title information via RDS text. 

RDS song information is limited to 64 characters and not supported by many RDS-capable FM radios.
END


BEGIN Music Lyrics
IMAGE illus/lyrics.jpg
Timed LRC and A2-enhanced LRC format music lyrics are automatically displayed in the audio player if available.

Put a LRC lyrics file with same name but with extension .lrc next to a music file to enable lyrics for that file.

Plain text lyrics and lyrics embedded in ID tags are currently not supported.
END


BEGIN Portrait Mode Operation
IMAGE illus/portrait-mode.jpg
Portrait mode can be enabled in the settings

 [Settings → Display Orientation]
 
You can choose whether the INCREMENT and DECREMENT keys on top of the device get swapped in portrait mode.

Video playback is not supported in portrait mode. This is a limitation of the Maemo OS.
END


BEGIN Indexing Media
MediaBox maintains an index over your media files.

This lets you, for instance, browse your music by artist, or gives you quick access to all your videos without you having to locate them in the filesystem.

Files that no longer exist get automatically removed from the index when you start MediaBox.
END


SUBBEGIN Indexers
On the N900, the built-in tracker file indexer is consulted for a list of available media files.

On the N800 and N810, the Metalayer Crawler service is used. Metalayer Crawler does not recognize pictures.
END


SUBBEGIN Manual Scanning
It may take some time until the system indexer discovers a particular file.

If you don't want to wait, or don't use an indexer for MediaBox at all, you can tell MediaBox to scan particular folders for media files immediately.

To do so, find the folder under [Storage & Network → Filesystem] and tap and hold on it to open its popup menu. Select

 → Scan for Media
 
from the menu.
END


SUBBEGIN Disabling the Indexer
It is possible to disable automatic file indexing altogether and only use manual scanning.

If you want to disable automatic indexing, go to

 [Settings → Media Indexing]
 
and uncheck the checkbox

 → Always update index at startup
 
From now on, you have to scan folders manually if you want to put them in the index.
END


BEGIN Media Player Backends
MediaBox supports various backends for playing media, depending on the platform it's running on.

Go to

 [Settings → Player Backends]

to configure the backend to be used for a media type.

Be careful, as inappropriate backends may cause problems or unexpected behavior. If you don't exactly know about the details of the backends, it's recommended to keep the default settings.
END


BEGIN The Sleep Timer
With the sleep timer, you can have MediaBox automatically stop playing or start playing at a given time. Go to

  [Settings → Sleep Timer]

for configuring the timer.

The sleep timer simulates pressing the PLAY / PAUSE button.
END
